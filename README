OpenRC-settingsd provides an implementation of the the hostnamed, localed,
and timedated D-Bus services for OpenRC-based systems.

This project was originally maintained by Gentoo's GNOME desktop team, but did
not have activity since the 1.0.1 release in 2012. After several unsuccessful
attempts to upstream patches, postmarketOS developers decided to maintain a
fork at: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/openrc-settingsd

Hostnamed:

 See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/hostnamed for the D-Bus
 protocol description.

 The static hostname is stored in /etc/conf.d/hostname as
 hostname="foo"

 The pretty hostname and icon name are stored in /etc/machine-info as
 PRETTY_HOSTNAME="Foo !"
 ICON_NAME="computer-desktop"

 It is strongly recommended that hostnamed be used with nss-myhostname
 (http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-myhostname/) to ensure the local
 host name always remains resolvable.

Localed:

 See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/localed for the D-Bus
 protocol description.

 The system locale variables are set in /etc/env.d/02locale.

 Virtual console keymap is set in /etc/conf.d/keymaps as
 keymap="foo"
 The virtual console keymap toggle is not supported.

 X11 keyboard options are set in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-keyboard.conf
 (falling back to 00-keyboard.conf if it exists and 30-keyboard.conf does
 not). See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml for configuration
 information.

Timedated:

  See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/timedated for the
  D-Bus protocol description.

  The RTC UTC vs. local time setting is set in /etc/conf.d/hwclock as
  clock="UTC" or clock="local".

  The timezone is set in /etc/timezone and /etc/localtime.

  OpenRC-settingsd attempts to auto-detect an appropriate ntp implementation.
  To avoid auto-detection, use the --ntp-service command line option.

Note that OpenRC-settingsd expects any shell-syntax settings files that it
modifies to be in UTF-8 encoding, and to consist only of comments and simple
scalar assignments, i.e. something like

# a comment
foo="bar"
baz='Let'\''s go!'

If OpenRC-settingsd fails to parse a settings file, it will refuse to modify
it.
